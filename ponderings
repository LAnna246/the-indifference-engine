*/ How will the algorithm look in space, conceptually
+ ALIKE TO MYERS BRIGGS P AND J.......
ONE BEING THE PATH (J) AND ONE BEING THE POSSIBILITIES (P)
SO TOO COULD THIS ALGORITHM HAVE MANY POSSIBILITY DISCS (P) 
AND (J) BEING THE ANSWER - A STRAIGHT LINE INTERSECTING AT OPTIMAL TIME

+HOW THIS TRANSPOSES TO A SINE WAVE/S
THE ALGORITHM SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE A MANY POSSIBILE CONSTRAINTS EACH AS A SINE WAVE
OVERLAYED TOGETHER IN A CARTISIAN PLANE (3D PLANE) WHICH IS REFLECTIVE OF SPACE ITSELF
THE LINE OF OPTIMAL OR THE ANSWER IS DISCOVERED BY THE MOST POINTS INTERSECTED OR OVERLAYED
IN SYNCHRONICITY WITH EACH OTHER (OPTIMAL CONDITIONS OF ALL OF THE POSSIBLE CONSTRAINTS)
WHILST OTHER CONSTRAINTS MAY NEED TO BE AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE IN SPACE (AKA NOT IN SYNC)
IF THEY ARE "BAD CONSTRAINTS". 

*********** WE NEED A RATING SYSTEM TO RATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH CONSTRAINT WITH 10 BEING THE 
HIGHEST RATING FOR AN OPTIMAL CONSTRAINT AND 1 BEING THE LOWEST RATING AKA NOT OPTIMAL AND 5 BEING NEUTRAL OR 
HAVING NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ****** 
EACH POSSIBLE CONSTRAINT COULD BE REPRESENTED AS A SINE WAVE OF A DIFFERENT COLOUR TO BE ABLE TO VISUALLY AND 
VERBALLY IDENTIFY IT - SO THE E.G COLOUR FOR MECURY COULD HAVE ORANGE_MECURY AS ITS NAME AND BE ORANGE IN COLOUR OF SINE WAVE.
