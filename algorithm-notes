// SINE WAVE MATH
*/ 
"A sine wave is a repetitive change or motion which, when plotted as a graph, has the same shape as the sine function.
In general, a sine wave is given by the formula
A	 sin 	 (	w	t	) 	
In this formula 
the frequency is w.
the amplitude is A."

//MECURY ROTATION
*/ 
"Mercury is rotating very slowly, at a rate comparable to its orbital angular
frequency. More precisely, he claimed that the rotation period was exactly the same as the
period of revolution of the planet around the Sun, i.e. that Mercury was locked in a synchronous
state."
"...the most favourable conditions for observing the planet are
separated in time by three synodic periods, in addition to the fact that the rotation, orbital and
synodic periods are almost exactly in a 6:4:3 resonance (see figures 2 and 3)."
