// SINE WAVE MATH
*/ 
"A sine wave is a repetitive change or motion which, when plotted as a graph, has the same shape as the sine function.
In general, a sine wave is given by the formula
A	 sin 	 (	w	t	)
In this formula 
the frequency is w.
the amplitude is A."

//MECURY ROTATION
*/ 
"...the most favourable conditions for observing the planet are
separated in time by three synodic periods, in addition to the fact that the rotation, orbital and
synodic periods are almost exactly in a 6:4:3 resonance (see figures 2 and 3)."

+(+ AND BOLD CASE TYPING = MEANS USER'S OWN WRITING) 
+THE 6:4:3 RESONANCE OF THE ROTATION (AROUND SUN), ORBITAL(AROUND EARTH) AND SYNODIC PERIODS (ROTATION ON ITSELF)
ARE EXPLORED BELOW AND REFER TO TEXT LINK IN REF: AT END OF THIS NOTE FOR VIEWING OF FIGURES.

"Mercury is rotating three times on itself in exactly the time it takes to make two
revolutions around the Sun"

"Figure 2. Spin–orbit resonance. The arrow indicates the orientation of the long axis of Mercury.
It takes two revolutions around the Sun to return to the original configuration in inertial space."

"Figure 3. The path of Mercury with respect to the Sun–Earth reference direction. The solid
circles represents the position of the planet at one orbital period intervals. Since position ‘4’ is
almost coincident with the initial position ‘0’, we are in presence of an approximate 4:3 resonance
between the orbital and synodic periods. This coincidence may explain the historical difficulty in
determining the planetary rotation rate, as described in the text."
