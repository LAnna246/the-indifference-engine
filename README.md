An astrology programs for finding time based events based on contraints

# problem domain
Traditional astrology programs find optimal astologicl events by stepping throught time based sequences.
This project intents to make use of the fact that planetary objects move in preditable patterns (perhaps a corelation of 2-3 sinosodal functions) and can therefore find the desired events more readily.
